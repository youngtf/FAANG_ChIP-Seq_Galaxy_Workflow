Galaxy Tools for ChIP-Seq data analysis (FAANG standard)
========================================================

## Galaxy workflow for main Galaxy server

This folder includes workflow files that can be directly used in the [main Galaxy server](https://usegalaxy.org/). 

## How to use

The workflow can be accessed through the URL:

1. Preprocessing: https://usegalaxy.org/u/tianfu/w/faang-chipseq-1-preprocessing-se


Or the .ga file can be upload to the main Galaxy server

## Features

Currently the workflow can finish the following analysis:

1. Raw reads trimming, QC, alignment.
2. Generating report about usable fragments and library complexity.

Further metric reports require custom tools and currently can not be generated in the main Galaxy server. Try local Galaxy instance instead (tools in preparation).
