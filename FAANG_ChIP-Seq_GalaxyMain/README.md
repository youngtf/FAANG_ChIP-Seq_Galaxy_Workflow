Galaxy Tools for ChIP-Seq data analysis (FAANG standard)
========================================================

## Galaxy workflow for main Galaxy server

This folder includes workflow files that can be directly used in the [main Galaxy server](https://usegalaxy.org/). 

## Features

Currently the workflow can finish the following analysis:

1. Raw reads trimming, QC, alignment.
2. ChIP-seq peak calling

Further metric reports require custom tools and currently can not be generated in the main Galaxy server. Try local Galaxy instance instead (tools in preparation).

## Usage

A munual is in preparation.

## Known issues
1. The QC workflow was not able to remove reads from MT.
